# Airfare-Prediction-using-ML
Predicting Airfare prices using machine learning models

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python  which already has the above packages and more included. However if you wish to run it online rather than your local machine you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) which also has the necessary packages installed.

### Data

This project is used to predict the fares of airlines using the dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh). This dataset contains 10683 data-points with each having 13 features such as the airline, route, departure time, arrival time etc. We would be starting from cleaning the datset to data visualization to preprocessing and splitting the dataset to feature engineering to model selection and lastly hyperparameter tuning.

#### Note: The 'Training Files' folder contains both the training data as well as the preprocessed data.

### Code

There are two notebook files present in the project, Data_Preprocessing.ipynb and Model_creation.ipynb. The former contains the code for exploratory data analysis along with preprocessing the raw data so that it is suitable for training different machine learning models. The latter contains the code for training different machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning and making predictions. I have used 3 machine learning algorithms namely [Linear Regression](), [Random Forest Regressor](), [K-Nearest Neighbors]() Regressor and 1 deep learning neural network using tensorflow.

### Models

The trained models can be found in the 'Models' folder
